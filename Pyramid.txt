Reflection
What did you learn?
I learned how to solve the pyramid and the idea that the pyramid and the other cubes similar to it all have a pattern to how they can be solved at certain stages.

What I liked the best?
Learning something new is always fun and I enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of solving and timing the cubes. It's a puzzle to be solved that can be solved with the right skills and knowledge, almost like coding.

What could be better?
Nothing really, it was already an enjoyable expeperience.
